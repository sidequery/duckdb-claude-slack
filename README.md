# duckdb-claude-slack

Slack bot that queries Claude Code via the [DuckDB ACP extension](https://github.com/sidequery/duckdb-acp).

The ACP extension wraps Claude Code, giving it access to a DuckDB instance (read-only: no write, update, or delete capabilities) with NO access to the local filesystem or bash shell.

Let anyone on your team interrogate data in plain English, not just "data people." Ask a question in Slack, get results back as a CSV.
